 <h1 style="color:skyblue;"><b>  PNG foreign minister defends daughter<br> Savannah Tkatchenko's Tik Tok video<br> taken during coronation trip. </b></h1>



 
<p style="color:white;"> The video posted by Savannah Tkatchenko flaunts<br> extravagant meals in first class airport lounges and <br>"elite" shopping experiences at luxury brands on<br> the taxpayer-funded trip. </p>
 
<p style="color:orange;">The video has garnered widespread criticism in PNG,<br> with commentators saying money for the trip should<br> have been spent on improving healthcare, education <br>and other services in the impoverished county. </P>
 
 <p style="color:grad;">Speaking to ABC's Pacific Beat, Mr Tkatchenko<br> said critics of the video were<br><strong style="color:red;"> "primitive animals" with "nothing better to do".</strong>      </p>
 
 
 <p style="color:pink;">"My daughter now is totally devastated.<br> She is traumatised by some of the most<br> ridiculous and useless comments<br> that I've seen," he said.</P>
 <p style="color:brown;"> He also further went on saying and I quote "Jealousy is a curse. And, <br>you know, these people clearly show that they have got nothing <br>to do in their lives."</P>
